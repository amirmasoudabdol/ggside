Description: This package allows the user to add graphical 
  information about one of the main panel's axis using a familar 
  ggplot2 style API with tidy data. ggside extends ggplot2 and 
  should be loaded after ggplot2. Like ggplot2, ggside provides
  the user with full expressive control over their plots. ggside is
  particulary useful for metadata for discrete axis, or summary
  graphics on a continuous axis such as a boxplot or a density distribution.
